1. Use the ls command from the root (/) directory to explore the directory structure
of Linux. Move to each of the directories with the cd command and run pwd to
verify where you are in the directory structure.

Command: 
ls /

output:
"list of directories"

2. Use the whoami command to verify which user you are logged in as.
command:
woami

output:
current directory name

3. Use the locate command to find wordlists that can be used for password cracking.

command:
locate wordlists

output:
"list of txt files for brutforce attack content"


4. Use the cat command to create a new file and then append to that file. Keep in
mind that > redirects input to a file and >> appends to a file.

command:
cat > something 
cat >> something

output:
cat > "replace the content in file name call something or create it if doesn't exists"

5. Create a new directory called hackerdirectory and create a new file in that directory
named hackedfile. Now copy that file to your /root directory and rename it secretfile.

command:
mkdir hackerdirectory
cd hackerdirectory
touch hackedfile
sudo cp hackerdirectory/hackedfile /root/secretfile
