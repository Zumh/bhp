# create python3 environment
python3 -m venv venv3

# activate python env 
source venv3/bin/activate 

we learned that tcp client and server must use same port number for them to communicate in localhost 

we can detect PID or proccess id of client and server
ps aux | grep <any python file that we executed>

we can kill PID 
kill -9 <PID>

UDP client cannot communicate with tcp server because of different protocol

# start apache2 server 
sudo service apache2 start
sudo service apache2 restart
sudo service apache2 stop
